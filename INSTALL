Installation Instructions:

You need to run two scripts. First one obtains the dependecies and called
"get_dependencies.sh", the second one compiles the dependencies and OsiIpopt
and it is called "compile.sh". You need to run this scripts sequentially.
First get dependencies and then compile. Compile script will install the
OsiIpopt library to ./build/lib.

Following command will do the work for you.
./get_dependencies && ./compile

Installation Instructions for Advanced Users:
===============================================================================
If you already have the dependencies somewhere else in your computer and
you do not want to install them again, you are covered. First you need to
make sure that dependencies can be found with package config ("pkgconfig"
command). For this you need to add the directory that has .pc files of
dependencies to your PKG_CONFIG_PATH. You can test whether the dependencies are
accesible with pkg-config with the following command:
pkg-config --cflags --libs osi

Once the dependencies are accessible through pkg-config you can install
OsiIpopt by using regular "configure", "make" and "make install" sequence.
Configure script will find the dependencies through pkg-config and link
OsiIpopt to them.
